## Funding

This project is mostly a solo project and I love to work on it.

However, it is both a large time commitment and requires compute resources for training models.

If you think this project is valuable and want to express your gratitute, then please feel free to buy me a virtual coffee [here](https://ko-fi.com/martin_l) :-).

Thanks!!
