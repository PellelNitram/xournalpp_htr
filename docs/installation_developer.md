# Development installation

1. Perform the same installation steps as described in the [user installation manual](installation_user.md).
2. Then, install developer dependencies: `pip install -r requirements_training.txt`.

Depending on your needs, it is probably worth creating a dedicated Python environment for development. To do
so, simply change `xournalpp_htr` from [user installation manual](installation_user.md) to another name like `xournalpp_htr_dev` when you follow the above development installation steps.
