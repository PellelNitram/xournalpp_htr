## Why Handwritten Text Recognition for Xournal++?

A key benefit of digital note-taking is searchability, which digital handwritten notes lack
without [handwritten text recognition (HTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition).
While many commercial apps offer this feature, no open-source, privacy-focused handwriting
app does - until now.

The **Xournal++ HTR** project aims to bring on-device handwriting recognition to
[Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/), a leading open-source note-taking platform.
This will make handwritten notes searchable while ensuring user privacy through local data
processing.

## Content of these websites

These websites document Xournal++ HTR. In the navigation bar, you can find instructions on
how to install the project, use the project and more advanced topics like how you can contribute
code and own models. In the future, many of the documents will come with small videos to get you going quicker.

<!-- To assist you in training your own models, Xournal++ HTR comes with many helper functions and -->
<!-- convenience code infrastructure. -->
